# Pilgrams

## Greyhawk and Verbobonc:
The Free City of Greyhawk is, of course, one of the
most cosmopolitan places in the Flanaess. Faiths of
every description can be found there openly, with the
exception of the most foul sects of demon- and devilworshipers.
Despite this, there exist within the lands
claimed by the City no destinations for pilgrimage*4,
and those on such journeys are not often found within
its domains. Those that are encountered there will be
passing through, with a 50% chance of being destined
for nearby Verbobonc.
Verbobonc itself is a stronghold of the faith of St.
Cuthbert, which is unsurprising given its strong ties to
Veluna and Furyondy to the north. Several shrines to
the Saint exist within the Viscounty, marking several
minor events during Cuthbert's mortal life including the
Church of the Holy Cudgel, marking the spot where
Cuthbert first cut and hefted the wooden bludgeon for
which he would become so famed.
Evil aligned pilgrims found in Verbobonc will
sometimes (25% chance) be seeking the ruins of the
Temple of Elemental Evil in the Kron Hills. Otherwise,
they will simply be on their way to some other unholy
shrine in the Flanaess, most probably one of the
several well-hidden temples of Nerull in Furyondy and
Veluna.


## Furyondy, Shield Lands, and Veluna:
The faith of Saint Cuthbert of the Cudgel is very wellentrenched
within the lands of the central-west
Flanaess. Lawful Good pilgrims encountered here will
most certainly belong to that faith, and will be most
zealous and earnest in their devotion. The Great
Cathedral of Mitrik attracts the faithful from all over the
Flanaess, along with the Church of the Apotheosis,
which marks the spot where Cuthbert was raised to
Godhood in a blast of light and crashing of tree-limbs.
Those of chaotic good or neutral alignment will be
making for the temple of the beautiful Myhriss, whose
temple at Chendl has seen the weddings of nobility
from across the Flanaess for many years (25% chance
the pilgrims encountered are specifically on their way
to attend such a wedding as a holy obligation). Any evil
pilgrims encountered here will be in disguise, and en
route to either the Horned Society (if lawful evil is
rolled, they will be in fact of neutral evil alignment and
headed to Molag to pay obeisance to the lords of
Hades) or Iuz (if chaotic evil).

##Blackmoor:
Pilgrims of all alignments found in this strange boreal
land will be bound for the same place; the mysterious
ruined city which extends for miles between the Cold
Marshes and the sea. Most will be worshipers of
strange and degraded cults seeking either
enlightenment, power, or bear other, more alien,
motives. Even those of good alignment will be odd in
their manner and distrustful of outsiders, albeit not
overtly hostile. Such pilgrims will often know secrets of
the temples and shrines of the city that are unknown
even to the most knowledgeable of sages. 



# Counterspells in AD&D
(December 28, 2008) (December 28, 2008)
Chgowiz has a fascinating post8 up on his blog tonight,
dealing with the topic of counter-spells. Turns out that
in the hoary mists of the Chainmail Fantasy
Supplement, Wizards could attempt to counter the
effect of other Wizards on the battlefield. I looked it up,
because I didn't remember that particular rule, but sure
enough there it was.
Essentially, a more powerful Wizard can spend his turn
attempting to counter an enemy Wizard's spells. If he is
more powerful than the enemy, he counters the spell
on a 7-12 on 2d6. If less powerful, he needs to roll 8,
9, 10 or 11. That works out to around 58.3% and
38.9%, respectively. There's no such thing as equally
matched Wizards, apparently; in case of a tie, a die roll
determines relative strength.
Obviously, the AD&D rules are more granular when it
comes to magic and magic-users, so a tad more
expansion is called for if deciding to adapt these rules
to AD&D use. I've not playtested this, of course, but I
might do something along the following lines.
Counter- Counter-Spells
Any magic-user is able to use the magical energy
stored in his mind to attempt to counter the effects of
another magic-user's spell. A counter-spell has an
effective casting time of instantaneous. The countering
magic-user informs the Dungeon Master of his
intention to attempt to disrupt the casting of another
magic-user (magic-users and illusionists can disrupt one
anothers' spells in this fashion, but not clerical spells),
and chooses a spell from his own list of memorized
spells to use, before the nature of the enemy spell is
known.
(In this way, the choice of which spell to "burn"
becomes a real decision and something of a blind bid;
do you waste a fireball spell when the enemy could
only be casting magic missile?)
Roll 2d6 and compare the level of the spell burned vs.
the level of the spell being countered.
|Level Difference| Countered On Role Of...|
|----------------|:______________________:|
|-9| automatic|
-7 - -8 3-12
-5 - -6 4-12
-3 - -4 5-12
-1 - -2 6-12
0 7-12
1 - 2 8-12
3 - 4 9-12
5 - 6 10-12
7 - 8 11-12
9
9 12
The difference here between this and the system found
in Chainmail is not only the granularity of the odds, but
also using the level of the spell as opposed to the level
of the caster. If you really want to get into it, a modifier
for level of caster could also be included, but you'd
need to jig it so as to bear the minimum caster level for
a given spell level in mind. I would probably give an
automatic success if one happened to burn the exact
same spell being cast, especially since it's a blind
choice.
Playtesting might also indicate that my own table
above is too generous; a 7th level spell should be able
to squash a cantrip with no chance of failure. I could
also see spreading out the energy in the case of
multiple spell-casters, attempting to counter several
lower-level spells with one high-level spell in a single
go. But I'll save that for another day.

9 Counting cantrips as 0-level spells, it is possible,
however unlikely, that a cantrip could be used to
counter a wish spell. Yes, I like cantrips. Wanna make
something of it? ;-)
This is just a first pass, inspired by that great post. I
will drop this into my next AD&D campaign and see
how it works.
